## 2025-02-04 - State Mutation and O(n) rendering
**Learning:** Found that `QuantumEngine.transition` was mutating the `history` array in place. This is a critical React anti-pattern that breaks `useMemo` dependencies, as the array reference remains the same. Additionally, `PersonalInsight` was performing an O(n) filter on the history array on every render to calculate a count that could be easily pre-calculated.
**Action:** Implement immutable state updates and move expensive calculations to the state transition logic to achieve O(1) render performance for those values.

## 2025-02-05 - Efficient History Rendering
**Learning:** Found that using `reverse()` on an array before mapping it in React causes O(n) computation and, more importantly, breaks key stability if using indices, leading to O(n) DOM updates.
**Action:** Use `display: flex; flex-direction: column-reverse;` on the container to achieve visual reversal without array modification. Use absolute indices from the original array as keys to maintain stability, resulting in O(1) updates when new items are appended. Additionally, slice the history to a reasonable limit (e.g., last 50) to avoid DOM bloat.

## 2025-02-10 - Synchronous Storage Blocking
**Learning:** Found that `QuantumContext` was persisting the entire state to `localStorage` synchronously on every render. As `state.history` grows indefinitely, this O(N) serialization and write operation blocks the main thread, causing UI jank during rapid interactions.
**Action:** Implement a debounce mechanism (e.g., 500ms) for `localStorage` writes to decouple UI updates from expensive persistence operations.
