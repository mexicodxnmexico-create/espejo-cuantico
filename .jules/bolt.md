## 2025-02-04 - State Mutation and O(n) rendering
**Learning:** Found that `QuantumEngine.transition` was mutating the `history` array in place. This is a critical React anti-pattern that breaks `useMemo` dependencies, as the array reference remains the same. Additionally, `PersonalInsight` was performing an O(n) filter on the history array on every render to calculate a count that could be easily pre-calculated.
**Action:** Implement immutable state updates and move expensive calculations to the state transition logic to achieve O(1) render performance for those values.

## 2025-02-05 - Efficient History Rendering
**Learning:** Found that using `reverse()` on an array before mapping it in React causes O(n) computation and, more importantly, breaks key stability if using indices, leading to O(n) DOM updates.
**Action:** Use `display: flex; flex-direction: column-reverse;` on the container to achieve visual reversal without array modification. Use absolute indices from the original array as keys to maintain stability, resulting in O(1) updates when new items are appended. Additionally, slice the history to a reasonable limit (e.g., last 50) to avoid DOM bloat.

## 2025-02-12 - Debounced Persistence and State Capping
**Learning:** Found that unbounded growth of the 'history' array in the state leads to increasingly expensive JSON serialization and localStorage operations on every user interaction. Debouncing the persistence effect and capping the history length ensures constant-time state management and improves Interaction to Next Paint (INP).
**Action:** Implement a 1000ms debounce for localStorage saves and a hard cap of 100 items for the history array in the state transition engine.
