## 2024-05-23 - Custom Modal Accessibility
**Learning:** Custom modals (e.g., in 'components/Onboarding.tsx') require explicit 'role="dialog"', 'aria-modal="true"', and focus management using 'useEffect' and 'useRef' to ensure accessibility, as they are implemented with 'div' overlays.
**Action:** Always wrap custom modal content in semantic containers with ARIA attributes and manage focus programmatically on mount and step changes.

## 2024-05-24 - Scrollable Region Accessibility
**Learning:** Scrollable regions (like history logs) require 'tabIndex={0}' and an accessible name to be navigable via keyboard.
**Action:** Always add 'tabIndex={0}', 'role="region"' (or semantic role like 'log'), and 'aria-label' to custom scrollable containers.

## 2024-05-24 - Text Contrast Standards
**Learning:** Text color '#999' on light backgrounds (e.g., '#fafafa') fails WCAG AA contrast ratio (approx 2.9:1).
**Action:** Use '#555' (approx 7.5:1) or darker for secondary text to ensure readability for all users.

## 2025-03-15 - Critical Error State Accessibility
**Learning:** When a system enters a critical error or collapsed state that disables primary UI interactions, simply rendering the state is insufficient. It requires 'role="alert"' to announce the critical state and explicit focus shifting (via 'autoFocus' or 'useEffect' with 'useRef') to the primary recovery action to maintain accessibility.
**Action:** Always add 'role="alert"' to error containers and explicitly shift focus to the recovery button or primary text when a disruptive error state mounts.

## 2025-03-15 - Visual Headings as Form Labels
**Learning:** Using `<h3>` or other heading tags purely for visual styling above form inputs causes screen readers to misinterpret the document structure and leaves form inputs unlabeled, breaking accessibility.
**Action:** When replacing visual headings with semantic `<label>` tags for form inputs, use `htmlFor` to connect the label to the input's `id`, and apply `display: "block"` along with typography styles (e.g., `fontWeight: "bold"`) to preserve the original block-level visual layout without sacrificing accessibility.
